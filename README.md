Spersonify

Spersonify is using ES6 and transpiles it back to ES6 by using BabelJS with Webpack.
Styling is done through CSS 3.
Spersonify already supports Heroku so you can launch Spersonify into the web.


Getting started

Clone the repository.
cd into the repo and install the app with the commandline: npm install.
If you choose to run Spersonify locally you need to add the commandline run npm start on the repo folder. You can now visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app.
If you need to put Spersonify online you can easily push the repo to a service like Heroku.
